# Profile Card for Wynncraft
**WARNING**: If you use this, then please be noted, that it's just a test of mine.

**Used APIs**:
-*Wynncraft's Official API* (Of course) 
-*Crafatar* (Used for player avatars)


If you want to see your stats, then just edit this line on 88th row by replacing **"MartinNemi03";** with **"{your_name_here}";** and of course, in *"{your_name_here}"*, you *write down your name*. (If it's not on that row, use Ctrl+F and search it)
```
var PlayerName = "MartinNemi03";
``` 

It will find first listed class of that player in API and display it.
If it will say something like "Class not found", then just tell Martin on Discord or Wynncraft Forums about it and he will look into it.
